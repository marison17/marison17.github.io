        <p>Hi! My name is Mary, and I am passionate about data, development, and outreach work in computing.</p>

        <p>I graduate in August 2021 from Illinois Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Computer Science. During my
            time at IIT, I held an internship for an automotive tech company and developed/instructed 3 youth computing
            camps; two in robotics and computing using Lego Mindstorm EV3 and one in gaming and cryptography.</p>

        <p>While going through these experiences, I was able to grow and develop skills in ways I hadn’t expected.
            Through working at the Computer Discovery Camp, a camp aimed towards introducing middle-school girls to the
            world of CS, my team and I were able to present our curriculum at the STARS Celebration at the 2019 Richard
            Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference in San Diego, CA.</p>

        <p>Before this, I completed an internship in 2018 at Chroma Cars LLC in Elkhart, IN, a company that provides
            technical solutions for automotive dealers (website creation, inventory management, etc). I assisted with
            development, testing, and analytics visualization on a client’s website. Though this was challenging at
            first for me, I learned that I love finding solutions for problems, working with data, and that I highly
            prefer working with and around others.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I love to nerd out with any video or board game, and recently have been enjoying learning
            more about cryptocurrency. My other hobbies include vegan cooking, playing the guitar, and hiking
            with my friends in any forest we find!</p>
